# Database Management Final

Runners.py offers a command-line UI that allows the user to generate a MySQL database of randomly generated Track and Field race records. Each records contains the information of a runner: first name, last name, nationality, date of birth and gender. Once the entries are generated, the user is able to add, delete, and edit any characteristic of any entry. The user also has the option to query through the entries based on the names and times of the runners as well as draw analysis based on the times of the runners. The program will rank the top runner in an event and show the statistical difference to all other runners based on the top time. Lastly, the user can export the database to a .csv file that can be opened in Microsoft Excel.
